My week-8 quiz



# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
- Describtion of my chosen artwork
    - I chose this example because I like the way it automatically generates random squares, lines and circles with different colors to form an abstract painting after each page refresh. I would like to incorporate this artwork's ability to match different random shapes with different random colors into my project as I think it will make my final project more interesting as the random shapes, random colors and random generation will have a **strong visual impact** and will give the viewer space to **imagine** what adstract painting will show after they refresh the page.

    This is a code block!

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
- How this coding technique might help achieve or or contribute to the desired effect?
    - My goal in the final Major Project is to take a piece of art and render it in a different style after each page refresh, which are largely the same, but with slightly different details, such as colours, order of arrangement etc. The example code makes use of the drawing functions and random number generator provided by the **p5.js** library to create **abstract patterns** in an interesting way. Through randomness and variability, the pattern generated varies each time the code is run, demonstrating the beauty of abstract art.
