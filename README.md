My week-8 quiz


# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
- Describtion of my chosen artwork
    - I chose this example because I like the way it automatically generates random squares, lines and circles with different colors to form an abstract painting after each page refresh. I would like to incorporate this artwork's ability to match different random shapes with different random colors into my project as I think it will make my final project more interesting as the random shapes, random colors and random generation will have a **strong visual impact** and will give the viewer space to **imagine** what adstract painting will show after they refresh the page.
